    I love playing basketball and joining a bike races to satisfy my desire to achieve the priceless moment, whether I win or not. I am also into improvising things especially if it doesn't fit my taste. My mind won't let me sleep if I can't get the job done immediately. I'm good at creating ideas that can benefit my work, which allows it to become better. I often consider the things I want to apply to my work first, rather than letting my assumptions rule my decision. I am a hardworking student who doesn't allow failure to be the reason for my unfinished work. I have experienced a lot of hardships for the past years, but that didn't stop me from pursuing the goal I wanted. It also made me believe that <mark style="background-color: rgb(150, 150, 199);"><i>If you're dedicated to something, success will always follow<i></mark>.
